# Android-Malware-Detection
Developed a System using deep learning algorithm to rectify and predicted whether an android system is malicious or clean. The dataset on which the model is trained consist of 328 attributes and 4465 records.

2. Problem Statement:
Background: Developing an Android malware detection system capable of accurately identifying novel and polymorphic malware strains in real-time, considering the rapidly evolving landscape of Android malware threats.

Objective: To Detect whether the Android system consist of Malware or not 

Scope:

Protecting Against Data Theft: Protecting User Privacy & Preventing Financial Losses: Stealing sensitive information such as personal data, financial credentials, including contacts, messages, photos, and other files and location data. Malicious software often targets financial transactions and banking apps on Android devices. Detecting malware helps prevent unauthorized access to banking credentials and financial transactions, reducing the risk of financial losses for users.

Avoiding Control over the Device: If control over a device is taken, other malicious software can be installed which may worsen the situation.

Ensuring System Integrity: Malware can modify system settings, install unwanted applications, or tamper with system files, leading to instability, performance issues.

Preventing Malicious Activities: launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam emails, or spreading malware to other devices.

Safeguarding Corporate Resources: Many users use Android devices for work-related activities, accessing corporate email, documents, and networks. Malware on these devices can lead to data breaches, intellectual property theft, or unauthorized access to corporate resources.
